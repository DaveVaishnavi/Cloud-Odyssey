## 2. System Overview  

### 2.1 Architecture Diagram  
[Insert an architecture diagram using tools like Draw.io, PlantUML, or Mermaid.]

### 2.2 High-Level Component Description  

| Component | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| [Component Name] | [Brief description] |
| [Component Name] | [Brief description] |
